simkeytoy

(C) 2016 Peter Dunshee <peter@petezah.com>

This simulator derives from a sample in simavr, but implements
the use of a ST7735 TFT driver on top of simavr in addition to implementing
a stdin/out UART interface to interact with the AvrKeyboardToy. It 
runs identically in real life. 

The part has been tested using only the supplied driver.  Also, it implements only
the features of the TFT driver which were needed at the time.

The project requires simavr to build.
